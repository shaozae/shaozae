## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vishodu

Quick Overview:

- I'm a __DevOps Engineer__
- Currently learning and working on __Retrieval-Augmented Generation__ systems
- I am an ardent admirer of __Anthropic's Computer Use__ and the recently released __OpenAI's Operator__.
- I have a habit of hyperfocusing on __solutions__. My ongoing one is Img-Dash, an open-source centralised dashboard for VirtualMachine Images, which helps cloud-based companies manage their VM images better.
- I'm open to collaborating. I would love to write something open-source in a team. If you have any interesting opportunities, feel free to reach out.

  Always excited to connect with fellow devs. You can reach out to me through the following channels:

  * LinkedIn: [Vishodu Shaozae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaozae)

- Outside of my work, I enjoy running with the Nike Run Club app and playing Football Manager (as Tottenham Hotspur  :D )
